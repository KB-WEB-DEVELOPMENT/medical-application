Project Description

The purpose of this project was to delve deeper into ***Domain Driven Design*** (DDD) architecture when
building web applications.

J. Griffin's excellent book 'Domain-Driven Laravel' (Apress,2020) allowed me to better understand
how DDD key concepts are put into practice.

The book contains a real-world case scenario situation where a Laravel DDD application is
built for the healthcare sector.

If you would like to read about the application, the image hyperlink below should give you a general idea.

To understand the code and how I personally tackled each aspect of the application in detail, I wrote the paper below.
